            Hello! Thank you for visiting my portfolio site. I am a front-end
            web designer and developer based out of Minnesota. I specialize in
            creating custom Wordpress sites. When Iâ€™m not using Wordpress, I
            love spending time building out web-based projects utilizing various
            other technologies - React especially! Additionally, I am proficient
            in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, and tinkering around with After
            Effects for those Lottie animations.
